## About the Project

For this homework assignment I was tasked with creating a responsive web page using Bootstrap. I was given 3 different pages I needed to create. The pages were as follows:

- An index.html page with an "About Me" section and photo
- A contact page with a contact form that the user could submit
- A portfolio page with 5 pictures laid out using Bootstaps grid system

After I created these pages I needed to make sure they were responsive for the following screen sizes:

- 992
- 768
- 400

I was required to use my own pictures and personal details in the "About Me" section and Portfolio page.
