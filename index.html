            Hey everyone, I'm Jessica. I am a West Seattleite who loves dogs,
            absurdist fiction books, classic rock, camping and coffee. I moved
            to Seattle about 8 years ago from the small town of Sequim,
            Washington. My parents still live there and while it’s a great
            weekend getaway I would never choose to go back. I’ve found that
            Seattle is full of fascinating people and from the very first time I
            visited it had my heart. I currently live in a little 380 square
            foot loft apartment with my boyfriend of 10 years and our two dogs,
            Jolene and Lilly. Jolene is a 4-year-old, super excited Belgium
            Malinois and Lilly is a little 12-year-old blind pug. Together we
            all make up my little family here. My passion for coffee has led me
            to work for one of the best coffee roasters in the Seattle area,
            Fonte Coffee Roaster. I currently manage one of their coffee shops.
            It feeds my coffee addiction and I love getting to know all the
            regulars. I’m excited to break away from this job and start my
            journey into the tech industry with some of the skills I have
            acquired over the years while working for Fonte. That is just a
            little bit about me.
